<h2>Opening hours.</h2>
<p>Details of opening hours and how to find us will go here.</p>
<p>Our menu offers a wide range of breakfasts, brunches and lunches,
including a range of vegetarian options.</p>
<p>Whether you sip on a fresh, hot coffee or a cooling smoothie, you never
need to feel rushed - relax with friends or just watch the world go by.</p>

<h2>This weekend's special brunch</h2>
<p>This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg
on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted,<br> the secret to these eggs is
that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than
four eggs in the pan at a time.</p>
